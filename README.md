## ‚ö°Ô∏è Contribute

Captain is completely open-source. We've tried to make it as easy as possible to
contribute. If you'd like to help out by adding features, working on bug fixes,
or assisting in other parts of development, here's how to get started:

###### To begin working locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your
   local device: `git clone git@github.com:RickWong/Captain.git`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the app by starting electron, building the code and watch for changes:
   `yarn dev`

###### To build for production (should not generally be used):
1. Build the actual app for all platforms (Mac x64 and arm64 Apple Silicon): `yarn package`
